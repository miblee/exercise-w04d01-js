// 1.  We must acclaim the five kings: print to the console a hail to each,
//     using a new `hailTo` function and the `forEach` method:
//     "Long live King [name] of House [house]!" (five times...)
console.log("Number 1:");

// 2.  Now we must be sure to print the correct salute... For a "king" not on
//     the Iron Throne we must write a function `declaim` that returns the line:
//     "Woe be to the pretender [name] of the house [house]..."
console.log("Number 2:");

// 3.  Now we must hail all of the kings. Give a true hail only to the king on
//     the Iron Throne (where ironThrone is true), but not the others; instead we
//     must declaim them.
console.log("Number 3:");

// 4.  Write a function expression named `kneel` that prints:
//     "The [king/pretender] [name] of house [house] must kneel!"
console.log("Number 4:");


// 5.  Finally, the struggle begins: Loop over the list of kings, either hailing
//     or declaiming them as above (depending if they are on the Iron Throne);
//     at the end of each loop, remove one king at random and print the line
//     from #4 (that they must *kneel*), and then loop over the list again. Do
//     this until there is only one king left. If at any time the king on the
//     Iron Throne is removed, ensure that the next in line (the first king in
//     the list) is now placed upon it (their ironThrone property is set to
//     true).
